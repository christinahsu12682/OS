Really the ansatz is a family of quantum circuits, because some of the gates in the ansatz are parametrized, that is, they are fed a parameter which we can vary. This family of quantum circuits can prepare a family of quantum states approximating the ground state.\n",

        "At the core of a VQE problem is an operator that describes a system of interest. We will assume here that the lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of this operator are useful for some scientific or business purpose. Examples might include a chemical Hamiltonian describing a molecule, such that the lowest eigenvalue of the operator corresponds to the ground state energy of the molecule, and the corresponding eigenstate describes the geometry or electron configuration of the molecule. Or the operator could describe a cost of a certain process to be optimized, and the eigenstates could correspond to routes or practices. In some fields, like physics, a \"Hamiltonian\" almost always refers to an operator describing the energy of a physical system. But in quantum computing, it is common to see quantum operators that describe a business or logistical problem also referred to as a \"Hamiltonian\". We will adopt that convention here.\n",

        "A classical optimizer is any classical algorithm designed to find extrema of a target function (typically a minimum). They search through the space of possible parameters looking for a set that minimizes some function of interest. They can be broadly categorized into gradient-based methods, which utilize gradient information, and gradient-free methods, which operate as black-box optimizers. The choice of classical optimizer can significantly impact an algorithm's performance, especially in the presence of noise in quantum hardware. Popular optimizers in this field include Adam, AMSGrad, and SPSA, which have shown promising results in noisy environments. More traditional optimizers include COBYLA and SLSQP.\n",

This estimated energy is returned by the cost function, and the minimizer updates the information it has about the energy landscape.

Others may take noise into account and may require that the cost decrease by a large margin before accepting that the true energy decreases along that direction."

        "\n",
        "Some strengths have already been pointed out. They include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Suitability to modern hardware: Some quantum algorithms require much lower error rates, approaching large scale fault tolerance. VQE does not; it can be implemented on current quantum computers.\n",
        "*   Shallow circuits: VQE often employs relatively shallow quantum circuits. This makes VQE less susceptible to accumulated gate errors and makes it suitable for many error mitigation techniques. Of course, the circuits are not always shallow; this depends on the ansatz used.\n",
        "*   Versatility: VQE can (in principle) be applied to any problem that can be cast as an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem. There are many caveats that make VQE impractical or disadvantageous for some problems. Some of these are recapped below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some weaknesses of VQE and problems for which it is impractical have also been described above. These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Heuristic nature: VQE does not guarantee convergence to the correct ground state energy, as its performance depends on the choice of ansatz and optimization methods[\\[1-2\\]](#references). If a poor ansatz is chosen that lacks the requisite entanglement for the desired ground state, no classical optimizer can reach that ground state.\n",
        "*   Potentially numerous parameters: A very expressive ansatz may have so many parameters that the minimization iterations are very time-consuming.\n",
        "*   High measurement overhead: In VQE, an estimator is used to estimate the expectation value of each term in the Hamiltonian. Most Hamiltonians of interest will have terms that cannot be simultaneously estimated. This can make VQE resource-intensive for large systems with complicated Hamiltonians[\\[1\\]](#references).\n",
        "*   Effects of noise: When the classical optimizer is searching for a minimum, noisy calculations can confuse it and steer it away from the true minimum or delay its convergence. One possible solution for this is leveraging state-of-the-art error mitigation and error suppression techniques[\\[2-3\\]](#references) from IBM.\n",
        "*   Barren plateaus: These regions of vanishing gradients[\\[2-3\\]](#references) exist even in the absence of noise, but noise makes them more troublesome since the change in expectation values due to noise could be larger than the change from updating parameters in these barren regions."
